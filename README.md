### API Key Security

This project requires a Google AI (Gemini) API key. This key must be protected. The code is correctly configured to read the API key from a secure environment variable (`process.env.API_KEY`). You **MUST** configure this variable in your deployment environment.

### Local Development

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Start a local web server in the project directory (e.g., `python -m http.server` or `npx serve .`).
3.  Open the provided URL in your browser.
4.  *Note: For the API key to work locally, you need a setup that injects environment variables.*

### Deployment

1.  Go to your hosting provider's dashboard (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages).
2.  Connect your Git repository.
3.  Navigate to "Environment Variables" in your project's settings.
4.  Create a new secret variable: `API_KEY` with your secret Gemini API key as the value.
5.  Deploy.
