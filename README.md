# AURELION Guideform Evolution

A simple, interactive 3D visualization that responds to your microphone input. Watch the guideform pulse with your breath and change color with the rhythm of your voice.

This is a web-based prototype built with Three.js.

## Running the Application

This project is set up to be run in a specific development environment that transpiles the source code.

1.  **Build the code:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

You can then access the application at `https://localhost:8080`. You will need to grant microphone permissions for the visualization to work.
